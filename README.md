## The Problem

* Over 1 million US adults over the age of 40 are legally blind. [1] Statistic from Prevent Blindness survey

* Roughly 21 million US adults stated they either "have trouble" seeing or that they are blind. [2] Statistic from National Health Interview Survey Preliminary Report (2011)

* As of April 2014, there are over 958,919,789 websites on the internet available to the general public. [3] Statistic from http://news.netcraft.com article

## The Solution: Section 508

* Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973

* In 1998 the US Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. [5] Wikipedia article on Section 508

* Unfortunately, this requirement only holds said agencies to the standards outlined in Section 508. However when thought about early, simple adjustments to HTML source code can make all websites accessible.
